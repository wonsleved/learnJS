#Code editors

*A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.*

##IDE

- Visual Studio Code (cross-platform, free). 
- WebStorm (cross-platform, paid).

##Lightweight editors

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (cross-platform, free).
- [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) Text (cross-platform, shareware).
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows, free).
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool if you know how to use them.

##Letâ€™s not argue

The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, and personal preferences.
