# Scrolling

The `scroll` event allows reacting to a page or element scrolling.

```
window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
  document.getElementById('showScroll').innerHTML = window.pageYOffset + 'px';
});
```

The `scroll` event works both on the `window` and on scrollable elements.

## Prevent scrolling


We canâ€™t prevent scrolling by using `event.preventDefault()` in `onscroll` listener, because it triggers after the scroll has already happened.

We can prevent scrolling by `event.preventDefault()` on an event that causes the scroll, for instance `keydown` event for `pageUp` and `pageDown`.
