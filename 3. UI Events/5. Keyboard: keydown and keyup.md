# Keyboard: keydown and keyup

## Keydown and keyup

The `keydown` events - when a key is pressed down, `keyup` – when released.

### event.code and event.key

The `event.key` is exactly the character, and it will be different. But `event.code` is the same.
For another languages 'event.code', for instance Z, is `KeyZ` always.

***“KeyZ” and other key codes.***

- "Key<letter>"
- "Digit<number>"
- "Enter", "Backspace", "Tab"

For 'shift' `event.code` can be `ShiftRight` or `ShiftLeft`.

`event.code`: for different keyboard layouts, the same key may have different characters.

Do we want to handle layout-dependant keys? Then `event.key` is the way to go.

Or we want a hotkey to work even after a language switch? Then `event.code` may be better.

## Auto-repeat

Keys can be down for a long time, it causes auto-repeat. For events triggered by auto-repeat, the event object has `event.repeat` property set to `true`.

## Default actions

```
<script>
function checkPhoneKey(key) {
  return (key >= '0' && key <= '9') ||
    ['+','(',')','-','ArrowLeft','ArrowRight','Delete','Backspace'].includes(key);
}
</script>
<input onkeydown="return checkPhoneKey(event.key)" placeholder="Phone, please" type="tel">
```

The alternative approach would be to track the `oninput` event – it triggers after any modification.

## Legacy

In the past, there was a `keypress` event, and also `keyCode`, `charCode`, `which` properties of the event object.
