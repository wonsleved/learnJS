# Events: change, input, cut, copy, paste

## Event: change

`change` event triggers when the element has finished changing.

For text inputs that means that the event occurs when it loses focus, for select - when selection changes.

## Event: input

`input` event triggers every time after a value is modified by the user.

***Can’t prevent anything in oninput.***
`input` event occurs after the value is modified.

## Events: cut, copy, paste

These events occur on cutting/copying/pasting a value.

We can use `event.preventDefault()`.

`event.clipboardData.getData(...)`.

## Safety restrictions

The clipboard is a “global” OS-level thing. A user may switch between various applications, copy/paste different things, and a browser page shouldn’t see all that.
