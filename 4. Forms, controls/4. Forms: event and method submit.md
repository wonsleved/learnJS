# Forms: event and method submit

`submit` event triggers when the form is submitted.

## Event: submit

There are two main ways to submit a form:

1. To click `<input type="submit">` or `<input type="image">`. 
2. <kbd>Enter</kbd> on an input field.

***Relation between submit and click.***
When a form is sent using <kbd>Enter</kbd> on an input field, a click event triggers on the `<input type="submit">`.

## Method: submit

We can call `form.submit()`.

Then the submit event is not generated.
