# Focusing: focus/blur

The moment of losing the focus (“blur”).

Losing the focus generally means: “the data has been entered”.

## Events focus/blur

The `focus` event is called on focusing, and `blur` – when the element loses the focus.

```
input.onblur = function() {}
input.onfocus = function() {}
```

## Methods focus/blur

We can’t “prevent losing focus” by calling `event.preventDefault()` in `onblur`, because `onblur` works after the element lost the focus.

***JavaScript-initiated focus loss.***
`alert` and element is removed from DOM.

## Allow focusing on any element: tabindex

By default, many elements do not support focusing.

This can be changed using HTML-attribute `tabindex`.

There are two special values:

- `tabindex="0"` puts an element among those without tabindex.
- `tabindex="-1"` allows only programmatic focusing on an element. Tab key ignores it.

***The property elem.tabIndex works too.***

## Delegation: focusin/focusout

Events `focus` and `blur` do not bubble, but propagate down on the capturing phase.

There are `focusin` and `focusout` events – exactly the same as `focus/blur`, but they bubble.
