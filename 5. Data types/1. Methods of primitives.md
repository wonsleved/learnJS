# Methods of primitives

There are 7 primitive types: `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null` and `undefined`.

## A primitive as an object

- Primitives are still primitive. A single value, as desired.
- The language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, booleans and symbols.
- In order for that to work, a special “object wrapper” that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed.

***Constructors `String/Number/Boolean` are for internal use only***

***null/undefined have no methods***
