# Promises chaining

**A classic newbie error: technically we can also add many `.then` to a single promise. This is not chaining.**

All `.then` on the same promise get the same result – the result of that promise.

If a `.then` (or `catch/finally`, doesn’t matter) handler returns a promise, the rest of the chain waits until it settles. When it does, its result (or error) is passed further.

## Returning promises

A handler, used in `.then(handler)` may create and return a promise.

Returning promises allows us to build chains of asynchronous actions.

***Thenables.***
A handler may return not exactly a promise, but a so-called “thenable” object – an arbitrary object that has a method `.then`. It will be treated the same way as a promise.
