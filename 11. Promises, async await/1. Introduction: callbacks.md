# Introduction: callbacks

Many functions are provided by JavaScript host environments that allow you to schedule *asynchronous* actions. In other words, actions that we initiate now, but they finish later.

A function that does something asynchronously should provide a `callback` argument where we put the function to run after it’s complete.

## Handling errors

It calls `callback(null, script)` for successful load and `callback(error)` otherwise.

The convention is:

1. The first argument of the `callback` is reserved for an error if it occurs. Then `callback(err)` is called. 
2. The second argument (and the next ones if needed) are for the successful result. Then `callback(null, result1, result2…)` is called.

## Pyramid of Doom

A lot of nested callback with asynchronous actions called a pyramid of doom.
