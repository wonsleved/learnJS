# Microtasks

Promise handlers `.then/.catch/.finally` are always asynchronous.

## Microtasks queue

ECMA standard specifies an internal queue PromiseJobs, more often referred to as the “microtask queue” (V8 term).

As stated in the specification:

- The queue is first-in-first-out: tasks enqueued first are run first.
- Execution of a task is initiated only when nothing else is running.

## Unhandled rejection

**An “unhandled rejection” occurs when a promise error is not handled at the end of the microtask queue.**
