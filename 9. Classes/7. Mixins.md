# Mixins

Mixin â€“ is a generic object-oriented programming term: a class that contains methods for other classes.

JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance, but mixins can be implemented by copying methods into prototype.

Mixins may become a point of conflict if they accidentally overwrite existing class methods.

## A mixin example

```
class User extends Person {
  // ...
}

Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);
```
