# Static properties and methods

We can also assign a method to the class function itself, not to its `"prototype"`. Such methods are called static.

Use `static` keyword.

Static methods are used for the functionality that belongs to the class “as a whole”. It doesn’t relate to a concrete class instance.

## Static properties

Static properties are used when we’d like to store class-level data, also not bound to an instance. 

Technically, static declaration is the same as assigning to the class itself:

```
MyClass.property = ...
MyClass.method = ...
```

## Inheritance of static properties and methods

Static properties and methods are inherited.

How does it work? Again, using prototypes. As you might have already guessed, `extends` gives `Rabbit` the `[[Prototype]]` reference to `Animal`.

For `class B extends A` the prototype of the class `B` itself points to `A`: `B.[[Prototype]] = A`. So if a field is not found in `B`, the search continues in `A`.
