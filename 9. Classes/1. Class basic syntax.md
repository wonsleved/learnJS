# Class basic syntax

## The “class” syntax

```
class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}
```

***No comma between class methods***

## What is a class?

```
class User {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }
  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }
}

// proof: User is a function
alert(typeof User); // function
```

What class User {...} construct really does is:

1. Creates a function named `User`, that becomes the result of the class declaration. The function code is taken from the `constructor` method (assumed empty if we don’t write such method). 
2. Stores class methods, such as `sayHi`, in `User.prototype`.

## Not just a syntactic sugar

Important differences from `new F`:
- First, a function created by `class` is labelled by a special internal property `[[IsClassConstructor]]`: `true`. So it’s not entirely the same as creating it manually.
- Class methods are non-enumerable. A class definition sets `enumerable` flag to `false` for all methods in the `"prototype"`.
- Classes always `use strict`. All code inside the class construct is automatically in strict mode.

## Class Expression

Classes can be defined inside another expression.

```
let User = class {
  sayHi() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```

```
// "Named Class Expression"
// (no such term in the spec, but that's similar to Named Function Expression)
let User = class MyClass {
  sayHi() {
    alert(MyClass); // MyClass name is visible only inside the class
  }
};

new User().sayHi(); // works, shows MyClass definition

alert(MyClass); // error, MyClass name isn't visible outside of the class
```

## Getters/setters

Just like literal objects, classes may include getters/setters, computed properties etc.

## Computed names `[…]`

```
class User {
  ['say' + 'Hi']() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
}
```

## Class fields

“Class fields” is a syntax that allows to add any properties.

```
class User {
  name = "John";
}
```

The important difference of class fields is that they are set on individual objects, not `User.prototype`.

```
class User {
  name = "John";
}
let user = new User();
alert(user.name); // John
alert(User.prototype.name); // undefined
```

### Making bound methods with class fields

```
class Button {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
  click = () => {
    alert(this.value);
  }
}

let button = new Button("hello");

setTimeout(button.click, 1000); // hello
```
