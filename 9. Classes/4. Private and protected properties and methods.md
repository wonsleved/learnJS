# Private and protected properties and methods

One of the most important principles of object oriented programming – delimiting internal interface from the external one.

## Internal and external interface

- *Internal interface* – methods and properties, accessible from other methods of the class, but not from the outside. 
- *External interface* – methods and properties, accessible also from outside the class.

In JavaScript, there are two types of object fields (properties and methods):

- Public: accessible from anywhere. They comprise the external interface. Until now we were only using public properties and methods.
- Private: accessible only from inside the class. These are for the internal interface.

Protected fields are not implemented in JavaScript on the language level, but in practice they are very convenient, so they are emulated.

## Protected 

**Protected properties are usually prefixed with an underscore `_`.**

Protected fields are inherited.

Provide access to them through getters and setters.

## Private

Private fields are inherited, but not accessible in child class.

On the language level, `#` is a special sign that the field is private. We can’t access it from outside or from inheriting classes.


***Private fields are not available as `this[name]`.***
`this['#name']` doesn’t work, only `this.#name`
