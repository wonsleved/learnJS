# Code structure

## Statements

Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

## Semicolons

A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
***In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!***
***But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.***

## Comments

**One-line comments start with two forward slash characters `//`.**

**Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk `/*` and end with an asterisk and a forward slash `*/`.**

***Nested comments are not supported!***
There may not be `/*...*/` inside another `/*...*/`.
