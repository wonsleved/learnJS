# Basic operators, maths

## Terms: “unary”, “binary”, “operand”

- An *operand* – is what operators are applied to. 
- An operator is *unary* if it has a single operand.
- An operator is *binary* if it has two operands.

## Maths

- Addition `+`,
- Subtraction `-`,
- Multiplication `*`,
- Division `/`,
- Remainder `%`,
- Exponentiation `**`.

## String concatenation with binary +

If the binary `+` is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them.

If any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.

Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.

## Numeric conversion, unary +

The unary `+` converts everything to number.

## Assignment

## Bitwise operators

- AND ( `&` )
- OR ( `|` )
- XOR ( `^` )
- NOT ( `~` )
- LEFT SHIFT ( `<<` )
- RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>` )
- ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>>` )


## Comma

***Comma has a very low precedence***
