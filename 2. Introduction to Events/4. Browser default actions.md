# Browser default actions

- A click on a link – initiates navigation to its URL.
- A click on a form submit button – initiates its submission to the server.
- Pressing a mouse button over a text and moving it – selects the text.

## Preventing browser actions

Ways to tell the browser we don’t want it to act:

- `event.preventDefault()`.
- handler is assigned using `on<event>` (not by `addEventListener`), then returning `false`

***Returning false from a handler is an exception.***
The value returned by an event handler is usually ignored.

## The “passive” handler option

The optional `passive: true` option of `addEventListener` signals the browser that the handler is not going to call `preventDefault()`.

## event.defaultPrevented

The property `event.defaultPrevented` is `true` if the default action was prevented, and `false` otherwise.


Sometimes we can use `event.defaultPrevented` instead, to signal other event handlers that the event was handled.

***event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault().***
They are not related to each other.

***Nested context menus architecture.***
