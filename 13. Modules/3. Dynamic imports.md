# Dynamic imports

Export and import statements that we covered in previous chapters are called “static”. The syntax is very simple and strict.

Cons:

- The module path must be a primitive string, can’t be a function call. 
- We can’t import conditionally or at run-time.

## The import() expression

The `import(module)` expression loads the module and returns a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all its exports. It can be called from any place in the code.

```
let {hi, bye} = await import('./say.js');
```

***Dynamic imports work in regular scripts, they don’t require `script type="module"`.***

Although `import()` looks like a function call, it’s a special syntax that just happens to use parentheses (similar to `super()`).

So we can’t copy `import` to a variable or use `call/apply` with it. It’s not a function.
