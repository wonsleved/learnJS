# Export and Import

## Export before declarations

We can label any declaration as exported by placing `export` before it.

***No semicolons after export class/function***

## Export apart from declarations

We can put export separately.

```
export {sayHi, sayBye}; // a list of exported variables
```

## Import *

```
import * as say from 'path`;
```

But we should avoid it for the purpose of optimisation.

## Import “as”

```
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';
```

## Export “as”

```
export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};
```

## Export default

Modules provide a special `export default` (“the default export”) syntax to make the “one thing per module” way look better.

```
export default class User {...}
```

```
import User from './user.js'; // not {User}, just User
```

### The “default” name

```
export {sayHi as default};
```

```
import {default as User, sayHi} from './user.js';
```

### A word against default exports

Usually, to avoid that and keep the code consistent, there’s a rule that imported variables should correspond to file names.

## Re-export

“Re-export” syntax `export ... from ...` allows to import things and immediately export them (possibly under another name)

```
export {sayHi} from './say.js'; // re-export sayHi

export {default as User} from './user.js'; // re-export default
```

### Re-exporting the default export

We can come across two problems with it:

1. `export User from './user.js'` won’t work. To export use `export {default as User}`.
2. `export * from './user.js'` re-exports only named exports, but ignores the default one.

***

Import the module (its code runs), but do not assign any of its exports to variables:
- `import "module"`

We can put `import/export` statements at the top or at the bottom of a script, that doesn’t matter.

**import/export statements don’t work if inside `{...}`**
