# The modern mode, "use strict"

## “use strict”
The directive looks like a string: `"use strict"` or `'use strict'`. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

`"use strict"` can be put at the beginning of a function. Doing that enables strict mode in that function only.

***Ensure that `“use strict”` is at the top***

***There’s no way to cancel `use strict`***

## Browser console

When you use a developer console to run code, please note that it doesn’t use strict by default.
First, you can try to press <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd> to input multiple lines, and put use strict on top, like this:
```
'use strict'; <Shift+Enter for a newline>
//  ...your code
<Enter to run>
```

## Should we “use strict”?

Modern JavaScript supports “classes” and “modules” – advanced language structures (we’ll surely get to them), that enable `use strict` automatically. So we don’t need to add the `"use strict"` directive, if we use them.

**So, for now `"use strict"`; is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.**
