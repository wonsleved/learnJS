# Logical operators

There are four logical operators in JavaScript: `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), `!` (NOT), `??` (Nullish Coalescing). Here we cover the first three, the ?? operator is in the next article.

## OR "||" finds the first truthy value

A chain of OR `||` returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.

## AND “&&” finds the first falsy value

A chain of AND `&&` returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.

## ! (NOT)

The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

1. Converts the operand to boolean type: `true/false`.
2. Returns the inverse value.

A double NOT `!!` converts value to boolean.
