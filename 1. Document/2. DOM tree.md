# DOM tree

An HTML/XML document is represented inside the browser as the DOM tree.

- Tags become element nodes and form the structure.
- Text becomes text nodes.
- …etc, everything in HTML has its place in DOM, even comments.

## Autocorrection

If the browser encounters malformed HTML, it automatically corrects it when making the DOM.

***Tables always have `<tbody>`***

## Other node types

**Everything in HTML, even comments, becomes a part of the DOM.**

Even the `<!DOCTYPE...>` directive at the very beginning of HTML is also a DOM node.

The `document` object is a DOM node as well.

There are 12 node types. In practice we usually work with 4 of them:

- `document` – the “entry point” into DOM. 
- element nodes – HTML-tags, the tree building blocks. 
- text nodes – contain text. 
- comments – sometimes we can put information there, it won’t be shown, but JS can read it from the DOM.

We can use developer tools to inspect DOM and modify it manually.
