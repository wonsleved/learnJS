# Browser environment, specs

There’s a “root” object called window. It has two roles:

- First, it is a global object for JavaScript code, as described in the chapter [Global object](https://javascript.info/global-object). 
- Second, it represents the “browser window” and provides methods to control it.

## DOM (Document Object Model)

DOM represents all page content as objects that can be modified.

The `document` object is the main “entry point” to the page. We can change or create anything on the page using it.

***DOM is not only for browsers.***

***Exists CSSOM for styling***

## BOM (Browser Object Model)

BOM represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document.

For instance:

- The `navigator` object provides background information about the browser and the operating system.
- The `location` object allows us to read the current URL and can redirect the browser to a new one.

`alert/confirm/prompt` are also a part of BOM: they are directly not related to the document.
