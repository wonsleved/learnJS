# Native prototypes

## Object.prototype

But the short notation `obj = {}` is the same as `obj = new Object()`, where `Object` is a built-in object constructor function, with its own `prototype`.

When `new Object()` is called (or a literal object `{...}` is created), the `[[Prototype]]` of it is set to `Object.prototype`.

There is no more `[[Prototype]]` in the chain above `Object.prototype`.

## Other built-in prototypes

Other built-in objects such as `Array`, `Date`, `Function` and others also keep methods in prototypes.

By specification, all of the built-in prototypes have `Object.prototype` on the top. That’s why some people say that “everything inherits from objects”.

Some methods in prototypes may overlap.

## Primitives

Primitives also store methods in prototypes of wrapper objects: Number.prototype, String.prototype and Boolean.prototype. Only undefined and null do not have wrapper objects

## Changing native prototypes

Native prototypes can be modified.

```
String.prototype.show = function() {
  alert(this);
};

"BOOM!".show(); // BOOM!
```

**In modern programming, there is only one case where modifying native prototypes is approved. That’s polyfilling.**

## Borrowing from prototypes

```
let obj = {
  0: "Hello",
  1: "world!",
  length: 2,
};

obj.join = Array.prototype.join;

alert( obj.join(',') ); // Hello,world!
```
