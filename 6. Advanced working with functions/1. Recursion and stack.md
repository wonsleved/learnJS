# Recursion and stack

*Recursion* is a programming term that means calling a function from itself.

## Two ways of thinking

1. Iterative thinking
2. Recursive thinking

***Recursion is usually shorter***

The maximal number of nested calls (including the first one) is called *recursion depth*.

## The execution context and stack

When a function makes a nested call, the following happens:

- The current function is paused.
- The execution context associated with it is remembered in a special data structure called execution context stack.
- The nested call executes.
- After it ends, the old execution context is retrieved from the stack, and the outer function is resumed from where it stopped.

***Any recursion can be rewritten as a loop. The loop variant usually can be made more effective.***

## Recursive traversals

A recursively-defined data structure is a data structure that can be defined using itself.
