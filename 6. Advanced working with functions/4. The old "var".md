# The old "var"

## “var” has no block scope

Variables, declared with `var`, are either function-scoped or global-scoped. They are visible through blocks.

## “var” tolerates redeclarations

If we declare the same variable with `let` twice in the same scope, that’s an error.

With var, we can redeclare a variable any number of times. If we use `var` with an already-declared variable, it’s just ignored.

## “var” variables can be declared below their use

`var` declarations are processed when the function starts (or script starts for globals).

`var` variables are defined from the beginning of the function, no matter where the definition is (assuming that the definition is not in the nested function).

People also call such behavior “hoisting” (raising).

**Declarations are hoisted, but assignments are not.**

## IIFE

In the past, as there was only `var`, and it has no block-level visibility, programmers invented a way to emulate it.

```
(function() {

  var message = "Hello";

  alert(message); // Hello

})();
```
