# Global object


In a browser it is named `window`, for Node.js it is `global`, for other environments it may have another name.

The global object has a universal name `globalThis`.

In a browser, global functions and variables declared with `var` (not `let/const`!) become the property of the global object.

The global object holds variables that should be available everywhere.

```
var gVar = 5;
alert(window.gVar); // 5

let gLet = 5;
alert(window.gLet); // undefined
```

We should store values in the global object only if theyâ€™re truly global for our project. And keep their number at minimum.

## Using for polyfills

```
if (!window.Promise) {
  window.Promise = ... // custom implementation of the modern language feature
}
```
