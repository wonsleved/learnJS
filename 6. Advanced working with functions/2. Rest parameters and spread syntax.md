# Rest parameters and spread syntax

## Rest parameters ...

A function can be called with any number of arguments, no matter how it is defined.

```
function sumAll(...args) { // args is the name for the array
  let sum = 0;

  for (let arg of args) sum += arg;

  return sum;
}
```


***The rest parameters must be at the end***

## The “arguments” variable

There is also a special array-like object named `arguments` that contains all arguments by their index.

***Arrow functions do not have `"arguments"`***

## Spread syntax

**Works only with iterables**

```
let arr = [3, 5, 1];

alert( Math.max(...arr) );
```

For strings:

```
alert( Array.from(str) );
alert( [...str] );
```

There’s a subtle difference between `Array.from(obj)` and `[...obj]`:
- `Array.from` operates on both array-likes and iterables.
- The spread syntax works only with iterables.

## Copy an array/object

- When `...` is at the end of function parameters, it’s “rest parameters” and gathers the rest of the list of arguments into an array.
- When `...` occurs in a function call or alike, it’s called a “spread syntax” and expands an array into a list.

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let arrCopy = [...arr];

let obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
let objCopy = { ...obj };
```
